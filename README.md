# C - Binary trees
Tree Data Structrue
A tree is a non-linear abstract data type with a hierarchy-based structure. It consists of nodes (where the data is stored) that are connected via links. The tree data structure stems from a single node called a root node and has subtrees connected to the root.

* What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree.
* What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists.
* What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree.
* What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree.
* What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree.
